The combat field will consist of two parts: yours and enemy's (like disciples).

Unit types:
	- Melee - can attack only the front row and if in the front row. Can attack only "neighbor" units.
	- Reach - can attack from one row away. 
	- Short range - can attack up to 2 rows away.
	- Long range - can attack up to 4 rows away.

If you're attacking not the front row, you make 25% less damage to the target.

Idea for combat: you set up your actions. They will be executed in "AP Cost" order. You can forcebly make lower cost go after higher one. 
When you're ready all actions (your's and enemy's) will be executed in "AP Cost" order.
